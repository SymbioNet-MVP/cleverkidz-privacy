  <h1>Privacy Policy for CleverKidz</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 2025</p>

  <p>CleverKidz (“the App”) is an educational mobile application designed for young children to learn basic skills through images, sounds, and interactive activities. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains what information we do — and do not — collect.</p>

  <h2>1. No Personal Data Collected</h2>
  <p>CleverKidz does <strong>not collect</strong>, store, or share any personal data from users.</p>
  <p>We do not collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Names</li>
    <li>Email addresses</li>
    <li>Phone numbers</li>
    <li>Location data</li>
    <li>Photos, videos, or files</li>
    <li>Device identifiers</li>
    <li>Analytics or usage data tied to a person</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The App runs fully offline and uses only on-device storage for basic preferences or progress.</p>

  <h2>2. No Third-Party Sharing</h2>
  <p>Because we do not collect personal data, we also do not share any data with third parties, companies, advertisers, analytics providers, or external services.</p>

  <h2>3. Child Safety &amp; Legal Compliance</h2>
  <p>CleverKidz is designed for children under 13. We comply with applicable child privacy laws, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the United States</li>
    <li>The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), including provisions relating to children</li>
    <li>Google Play Families Policy Requirements</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not use tracking, profiling, behavioral advertising, or any features that require children to share personal information.</p>

  <h2>4. No Ads</h2>
  <p>The App does not display advertising of any kind, including third-party ads or personalized ads.</p>

  <h2>5. Parent Lock</h2>
  <p>Certain areas of the App (such as settings or external links) may be protected by a simple “parent lock” mechanism to help prevent children from leaving the educational experience or changing settings without an adult.</p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated “Last updated” date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
